#### Confused with a place name in Nepali language
A word from Nepali language can have different spellings in English language so the the idea here is to maintain a list of frequently used Nepali words in computer softwares. This will be act as a single point of reference for those words and play an important role in using them consistently in the digital words.

For example, Koshi is the name of a province in Nepal. How should one write its name in Nepali? 
कोशि or कोशी or कोसी?
